# TODO

- Compile C for MSP automatically
- Setup Arduino to regulate MSP
- C program Alpaca permuter (break code into random blocks)
  - Comments to denote important parts?
  - Single line complex statements?
- Choose test program
- Setup permute => compile => upload => measure => store pipeline
- Figure out how to represent data (pretty graphs)
